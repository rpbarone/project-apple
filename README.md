Project started in order to work on my creativity to solve new problems and put into practice the learning I acquired in the first chapter of edition 1 of the book: You Don't Know JS.

100% Responsive Layout! Try in your phone or computer.

Features introduced through JS
- Automatic calculation of interest on installment purchase
- Continuous update of the total purchase price, in case the user chooses to buy the phone with insurance or not, buying in more or less installments
- Verification if the user has enough balance on the card to make the purchase
- Creation of two credit cards to simulate a successful purchase (in the case of choosing card 1), or unsuccessful (in the case of choosing card 2, which has no sufficient limit)
